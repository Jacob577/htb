# Theory of Protection
hashed pw is stored in `shadow`

### Hashes:
    $1$ 	MD5
    $2a$ 	Blowfish
    $5$ 	SHA-256
    $6$ 	SHA-512
    $sha1$ 	SHA1crypt
    $y$ 	Yescrypt
    $gy$ 	Gost-yescrypt
    $7$ 	Scrypt

### LSASS

Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a collection of many modules and has access to all authentication processes that can be found in %SystemRoot%\System32\Lsass.exe. This service is responsible for the local system security policy, user authentication, and sending security audit logs to the Event log. In other words, it is the vault for Windows-based operating systems, and we can find a more detailed illustration of the LSASS architecture here.

    Authentication Packages 	Description
    Lsasrv.dll 	The LSA Server service both enforces security policies and acts as the security package manager for the LSA. The LSA contains the Negotiate function, which selects either the NTLM or Kerberos protocol after determining which protocol is to be successful.
    Msv1_0.dll 	Authentication package for local machine logons that don't require custom authentication.
    Samsrv.dll 	The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) stores local security accounts, enforces locally stored policies, and supports APIs.
    Kerberos.dll 	Security package loaded by the LSA for Kerberos-based authentication on a machine.
    Netlogon.dll 	Network-based logon service.
    Ntdsa.dll 	This library is used to create new records and folders in the Windows registry.

NTDS is often found on joint windows networkds
