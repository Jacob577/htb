```bash
solve 
20 * ________+ ________ = 65535
```

I thought of just multiplying 20 with 0 an set the other term to 65535, would've been te absolutely easiest answer. I didn't think about adding additional information to the equation to solve it or try that. That is because of convention, we are not supposed to do so since there are far easier solution. What I essentially did is removed one term which I on the other hand thought was the easiest. Hacker mindset is however to see the unconventional use cases
